# 🤝 Contributing to eBonsParser

Thank you for considering contributing to **eBonsParser**!

This project aims to become a general-purpose parser for German digital receipt (eBon) PDFs.  
Currently, only **REWE** is supported — but the codebase is designed to be modular and extensible.

## 📦 What You Can Contribute

- 🧾 Add support for other retailers (Lidl, Aldi, Edeka, DM, etc.)
- 🐛 Fix or improve parsing accuracy for REWE receipts
- 🔍 Improve item/weight/unit/tax extraction logic
- 🧪 Add tests and edge cases
- 📝 Improve documentation


## 🧾 Real-World Samples Welcome

If you can share anonymized PDF receipts from other retailers, please open an issue or attach the files.
